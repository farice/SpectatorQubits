        <h1>Model Violation Analysis: Robust data scaling</h1>
        <p>GST datasets are often <em>very</em> inconsistent with the Markovian gateset model.  This is relatively unsurprising, and means only that real qubits often drift or experience other forms of noise that aren't stationary and Markovian.  But this "voids the warranty" on GST's results, at least in principle.  The properties of the estimated gates usually appear to be meaningful anyway, but when the model is violated, normal methods for generating <em>error bars</em> become radically overoptimistic.  As a partial remedy for this, pyGSTi can be configured to generate "robust" analyses of model-violating data, by artificially deprecating data that are inconsistent with the fit (a variant of some robust statistics methods).</p>
