1.  Evaluate how well our strategy works when the error distribution is generated by a
    relatively well behaved function (continuous, bounded derivative etc).

2.  What if the error direction isn't known? Then we need to change our reward mechanism.
    Look into incorporating adaptive state tomography protocols.

3.  What happens when we add time dependence to our error model. We possibly need to move
    towards RL.

4.  Design better composite pulses for ion trap following Google's UQC-DRL paper. Start from
    a parameterized SK1 gate and vary the angles (using DRL) to find optimal pulses that retain
    SK1's benefits (eliminate over-rotation and crosstalk) but is resistant to phase errors
