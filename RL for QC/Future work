1. Evaluate how well our strategy works when the error distribution is generated by a 
relatively well behaved function (smooth, bounded derivative etc).
2. What if the error direction isn't known? Then we need to change our reward mechnanism. 
Look into incorporating adaptive state tomography protocols.
3. What happens when we add time dependence to our error model. We possibly need to move
towards RL.
